What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

My app is a mental health app. This app will give users the space to navigate, monitor their feelings and support them with their mental wellbeing. Therefore, it will allow users to select their mood, give them the ability to journal and also track the evolution of their mental health.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

This app is needed because I believe that our mental health is an essential part of our lives. It impacts the way we think, feel and behave. Thus, having this mental health app emphasies the importance of this, as it gives users the space and ability to feel comfortable with expressing the way they feel with no judgment and brings awarenesss to the significance of mental wealth.
